# wordCounter
Tasks:
Create an HTML page with:

A <textarea> for users to type or paste text
A <p> element to display the word count
A button to clear the input field
Write JavaScript to:

Detect when the user types in the textarea
Count the number of words (words are separated by spaces)
Update the displayed word count dynamically
Reset the textarea and count when the clear button is clicked
Edge Cases to Handle:

Ignore extra spaces (e.g., multiple spaces should not count as multiple words)
Consider empty input (should display "0 words")
Update count in real-time as the user types
Optional Enhancements:

Show both word count and character count
Highlight the longest word in the input
Limit input to a certain number of words or characters
